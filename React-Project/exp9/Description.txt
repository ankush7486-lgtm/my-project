Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses – Description
CLASS: Person
    ->Purpose: Defines the base structure for all persons.
    ->Properties:
        name: Required, string type (only alphabets allowed).
        age: Required, numeric type (positive integer).
    ->Methods:
        getDetails(): Returns "Name: [name], Age: [age]".
        Effect: Provides common attributes and methods that can be reused by subclasses.

CLASS: Student (extends Person)
    ->Purpose: Specialized subclass for student details.
    ->Additional Property:
        course or grade: Required, string type (represents enrolled course or grade).
    ->Methods:
        Overrides getDetails() → Returns "Name: [name], Age: [age], Course: [course]".
    ->Effect: Adds student-specific information while still inheriting from Person.

CLASS: Teacher (extends Person)
    ->Purpose: Specialized subclass for teacher details.
    ->Additional Property:
        subject or department: Required, string type (represents subject taught).
    ->Methods:
        Overrides getDetails() → Returns "Name: [name], Age: [age], Subject: [subject]".
    ->Effect: Adds teacher-specific details while still reusing base class properties.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
    ->Create a Person class with properties name, age, and a method getDetails().
    ->Create Student subclass:
        Inherits name and age from Person.
        Adds new property course.
        Overrides getDetails() to include course.
    ->Create Teacher subclass:
        Inherits name and age from Person.
        Adds new property subject.
        Overrides getDetails() to include subject.
    ->Create instances of Student and Teacher to demonstrate inheritance and method overriding.
